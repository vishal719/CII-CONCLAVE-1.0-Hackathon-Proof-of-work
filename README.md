# CII-CONCLAVE-1.0-Hackathon-Proof-of-work

ResQ is all in one alerting , reporting and platform system , unique mix of hardware and
software in which the hardware module is present itself on the vehicle for sensing and
sending the alerts to the required authorities and the app is present on the user’s phone for alerting and monitoring accident purposes.

Data like, the wreckage photo, location , the message regarding their need , all will be
available to the users which will make sure that the victim gets the proper and best
medical attention in the crucial time frame to their life.

Since the module is supposed to be mounted on 4 wheelers and as well as two
wheelers , it is designed to be lightweight so as to not mess up the weight balance of
the vehicle and not hinder the driving experience. Even talking in terms of size, the
ResQ module is roughly twice the size of an apple watch. It is quite cost efficient.After
the production is streamlined and ready for the market the cost will be lesser than the
cheapest smartphones currently. The delay between the sensor and the app is less than
10 seconds for fast alerting action, In order to reduce the number of false alarms, we
considered a lot of parameters.

NOVELTY POINTS:

● We plan to ride this new wave of customers who are more aware of the safety
aspect the vehicle

● We plan to provide a separate portal to emergency services like hospitals,police
NDRF etc which will provide more data than the normal app and also will receive
data

● Instead of spending on customer acquisition the product can be sold directly to
vehicle manufacturers. This way we automatically acquire their customer base

● Instead of spending on customer acquisition the product can be sold directly to
vehicle manufacturers. This way we automatically acquire their customer base

● The data obtained from the device can further be applied to ML predictive models
which can work as alarming system in the vehicle for the driver
